      Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Bow ties are cool. Brave heart, Clara. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Come along, Pond!
