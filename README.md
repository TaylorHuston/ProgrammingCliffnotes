# Programming Cliffnotes
##Who is this for?
If you're like me you jump between a lot of different programming languages. Sometimes, especially when you're just starting out, it can be hard to remember all of the nuances and peculiarities of each language. So I started keeping files of just commonly used, basic syntax for each language that I was using regularly, as a quick reference.

So if you need a crash course on a new language, or a refresher on one you haven't used in a bit, hopefully you will find this useful.

##Who is this not for?
Someone who is completely new to programming. This is a syntax reference. It's not a concept reference. It's not going to explain to you how inheritance or polymorphism or anything works conceptually. Just a quick reminder on how to implement them.

##Contributing
I am by no stretch of the imagination an expert in any of these languages. I am sure there are things that I missed. I am sure there are things I got wrong. If that's the case, don't hesitate to correct me.

Also note this isn't intended to cover every method of every object of every language. Just the most commonly used or particularly helpful syntax.

Currently there are Java, javaScript and Ruby notes. Any other languages are welcome though.
