# Programming Cliffnotes
##Who is this for?
If you're like me you jump between a lot of different programming languages. Sometimes, especially when you're just starting out, it can be hard to remember all of the nuances and peculiarities of each language. So I started keeping files of just commonly used, basic syntax for each language that I was using regularly, as a quick reference.

So if you need a crash course on a new language, or a refresher on one you haven't used in a bit, hopefully you will find this useful.

##Who is this not for?
Someone who is completely new to programming. This is a syntax reference. It's not a concept reference. It will show you how to make an array in a language. It won't tell you what an array is or why you'd want to use one.

##Contributing
I am by no stretch of the imagination an expert in any of these languages. I am sure there are things that I missed. I am sure there are things I got wrong. If that's the case, don't hesitate to correct me.

Currently there are Ruby and JavaScript notes. I plan on adding Java shortly, and C++ after that. Any other languages are welcome though.
