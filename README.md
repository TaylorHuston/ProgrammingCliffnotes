# Programming Cliffnotes
##Who is this for?
Programmers who alreafy have a good handle on the basocs. If you're like me you probably jump between a lot of different programming languages. Sometimes it can be hard to remember all of the little nuances and peculiarities of each language.

So if you need a crash course on a new language, or a refresher on one you haven't used in a bit, hopefully you will find this useful.

##Who is this not for?
Someone who is completely new to programming. This is a syntax reference. It's not a concept reference. It's not going to explain to you how inheritance or polymorphism or anything like that works on a theoreticalevel. It's just a quick reminder on how to implement them.

##Contributing
I am, by no stretch of the imagination, an expert in any of these languages. I am sure there are things that I missed. I am sure there are things I got wrong. If that's the case, don't hesitate to correct me.

Also note this isn't intended to cover every method of every object of every language. Just the most commonly used or particularly helpful syntax.

Currently there are Java, JavaScript and Ruby notes. Any other languages are more than welcome though.
