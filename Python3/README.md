# Python examples
Python is an interpreted language.
You can open the interpreter, usually just by something similar to  
`$ python`

You can run a python file with something similar to  
`$ python testFile.py`

You can also execute a python file, if it's been set to executable, ie  
`$ ./testFile.py`

Note that only works if you explicitly specify an interpreter in the source file
