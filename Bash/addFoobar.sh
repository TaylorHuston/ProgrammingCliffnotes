# $0 - Name of the script
# $1 to $9 - Arguments to the script. $1 is the first argument and so on.
# $@ - All the arguments
# $# - Number of arguments
# $? - Return code of the previous command
# $$ - Process identification number (PID) for the current script
# !! - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing sudo !!
# $_ - Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing Esc followed by . or Alt+.
